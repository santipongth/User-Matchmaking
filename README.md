# Enhancing a User Matchmaking Algorithm using Personalized PageRank

## Abstract
With the growing number of users in online communities and social networking platforms, it is becoming increasingly difficult for users to meet and connect with individuals who share similar opinions or interests. This paper proposes a user matchmaking algorithm based on personalized PageRank to recommend potential friends to an individual user. A set of user profiles is represented as a graph model for efficiently discovering hidden connections between users. The semantic relationship between two user profiles is then estimated using both word and sentence embeddings to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of the matchmaking process. Experiments on a simulated profile dataset show that the proposed algorithm consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of the F1-score and mean average precision metrics.

## Dataset Description
User profiles typically contain personal and sensitive information about individuals, making it challenging to collect and access this information without their consent. To address this issue, AI text generation systems, including ChatGPT and Google Bard, are utilized to automatically generate a user profile dataset as a simulated dataset that imitates human language. The simulated dataset consists of 150 user profiles, encompassing fields such as name, interests, hobbies, occupations, skills, and biographies. Finally, this dataset serves as a benchmark test for user matchmaking algorithms.
